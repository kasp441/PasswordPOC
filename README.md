# PasswordPOC
 proof of concept of zero knowlegde password manager

 ## how to use
 follow the promts, the most important thing to remember is the keyfile generated is the same keyfile used to decrypt your passwords

 # disclaimer
 ## IT IS THE USERS RESPONSIBLILITY TO STORE THE KEY 
 save the key file on a usb stick or another safe location.

### potential implemtations
* automatic key generation of usb stick to force users to use usb stick
* automatic key file search of all usb sticks attached to pc
* maui UI

# Security Model Overview

## Objective
To implement a robust security model based on zero-knowledge principles and strong encryption techniques.

## Key Components

1. **Master Key File Management:**
   - The master key is never known by the system or saved anywhere.
   - The master key is used solely to derive all other password keys.

2. **Password Derivation and Storage:**
   - All derived passwords are stored in a local file.
   - Each password is protected using Argon2d encryption.

## Detailed Flow

1. **Master Key Generation:**
   - The master key is generated by the user and is never stored or transmitted in the application.
   - The master key remains in the userâ€™s possession and is used only during the password derivation process.

2. **Password Derivation:**
   - The master key is used to derive individual passwords for different services or applications.

3. **Encryption and Storage:**
   - Derived passwords are encrypted using AES
   - Encrypted passwords are stored in a local file, accessed by sqllite

4. **Password Generation:**
   - Passwords will be generated based on the wished size between 8-15 characters in length.
   - A random number generator will then be used for each character wished.

## Security Considerations

- **Zero-Knowledge Principle:** The system does not have any knowledge of the master key, ensuring that even if the system is compromised, the master key remains secure.
- **Strong Encryption:** AES provides robust protection against brute-force attacks, ensuring the security of stored passwords.
- **Local Storage:** Storing passwords locally reduces the risk of exposure through network-based attacks.
